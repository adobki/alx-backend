# ___0x01.Caching___
This folder contains the actual results of completing the tasks in the project ___0x01.CACHING.___ The project was an introduction to caching techniques, algorithms, or policies. Cache replacement policies _(also known as cache replacement algorithms or cache algorithms)_ are optimizing instructions or algorithms which a computer program or hardware-maintained structure can utilize to manage a cache of information. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies))

The cache replacement policies/techniques covered were simple queue based policies FIFO and FILO/LIFO, and three simple recency-based policies LRU, MRU, and LFU.
