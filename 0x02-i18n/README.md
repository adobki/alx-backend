# ___0x02.i18n (Internationalisation)___
This folder contains my submissions for the tasks in the project named ___[0x02.i18n](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/1238).___ The project was an introduction to internationalisation _(**i18n** == i-18_letters-n)_ and localisation _(**l10n** == l-10_letters-n)_ in Python using a Flask API. **_Internationalisation_** is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes, while **_localisation_** is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components.

## Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Python packages/frameworks:

   i. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com): A simple framework for building complex web applications.

   ii. [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com): A very fast and expressive template engine.

   iii. [Flask-Babel](https://python-babel.github.io/flask-babel): Adds i18n/l10n support to Flask applications.

   iv. [pytz](http://pythonhosted.org/pytz): Provides world timezone definitions for localisation.

## Mandatory Tasks
There are eight mandatory tasks in this project, comprised of Flask apps (python scripts (_*-app.py_), a web page with jinja code (_[*-index.html](templates)_), and i18n/l10n translation files (messages.po and messages.mo)).

## Advanced Tasks
There is just one advanced task in this project, which is a Flask app (python script ([app.py](app.py)) and a web page with jinja code ([index.html](templates/index.html))) that extends the features of the packages in the mandatory tasks.
