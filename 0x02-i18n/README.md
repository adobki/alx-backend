# ___0x02.i18n___
This folder contains my submissions for the tasks in the project named ___[0x02.i18n](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/1238).___ The project was an introduction to internationalisation _(**i18n** == i-18_letters-n)_ and localisation _(**i10n** == i-10_letters-n)_ in Python using a Flask API. **_Internationalisation_** is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes, while **_localisation_** is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components.
